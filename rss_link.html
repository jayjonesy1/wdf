		<h2>Rise of the Guardians</h2>
		<p>Good film with fun characters and a decent plot. Good twist on imaginary characters like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny. Pitch Black makes a good villain and good opposite to Jack Frost as the hero.</p>
		<p>8/10</p>

		<h2>Dark Shadows</h2>
		<p>Funny film is entertaining. Throws in a few surprises to keep things interesting. Johnny Depp does a great job as vampire Barnabas Collins although the only downside would be the film not knowing whether to portray him as good or evil during some moments.</p>
		<p>8/10</p>

		<h2>Hotel Transylvania</h2>
		<p>Fun children film but plot gets boring part of the way in, picks back up near the end. The main monster characters are funny and have their moments but the kids story is predictable and uneventful.</p>
		<p>7/10</p>

		<h2>Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter</h2>
		<p>Really good interesting film, shows a different fantasy perspective on Abraham Lincoln. Great action and intense scenes. Tells a good story with good characters.</p>
		<p>9/10</p>
