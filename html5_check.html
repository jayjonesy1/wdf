					<p>A website for Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney.</p>
					<p>This only has two untitled sections although one of them is the nav and the 2nd I believe counts also as another nav further down the page. The rest are titled well with one being news and the others being the title of the news articles. However I feel those articles should be within the News section but I guess would work fine either way.</p>

					<p>A site that tells a story of a post apocalypse world in 2156.</p>
					<p>This is missing a ton of stuff. Untitled Sections are everywhere although ones that are on there do mostly make sense. Because this site is interactive and is not a whole lot of writing would most likely explain why they don't have titled sections.</p>

				<a href="comic.png">
				<img height=100 width=200 src="comic.png" alt="Comic ETC"></a>
					<p>A comic book store website.</p>
					<p>Has a poor list. The first main title just says enter which makes no sense and is not the title of their site or anything. Near the end the comics sort of fade out a bit and make less sense. It will just say shipping but you won't know what one its linked to or anything.</p>

					<p>They do research, planning and event management.</p>
					<p>They are missing quite a few key headings on the 2nd type tier of the list. They also have a lot that make no sense to anyone but probably them. They are most likely quotes used about stuff but does not actually describe the content in that section.</p>
